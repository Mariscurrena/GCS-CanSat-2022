Ground Control Station - CanSat 2022

Hello there netizen. Angel here!

I see that you arrived to this project. Let me explain some things.
  1. This software was developed in Java using the JavaFX library, so if you want to take a look of how does it works, make sure you have this tool.
  2. I coded this in order to use it in the CanSat Competition 2022 organized for Virginia Tech.
  3. The objective of this software is represent in all the mision of a CanSat (Can Satelite) the values that the device is reading, also, give us the possibility to send commands to our satelite, simulate a mission, made communication pruebs, save all the data into a DataBase, etc.

This software was developed for myself, but is property of Cuauhtemoc IPN Aeroespace, so feel free to check it in order to solve some doubts and learn more about this kind of software. However, I really encourage you to make your own Graphical Interface for a Sat's Ground Control Station. This is just one of the million the possibilities that this type of interface has.

Best regards, Angel!

Btw, if you just want to take a look of how the software looks like, I paste some photos for you, enjoy it!
